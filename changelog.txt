Comment from reviewer: 
"Response has correct format – field walletAddress should be renamed to address"
My response: 
Though I have renamed the field, project instructions are inconsistent. 
Some places they have used "walletAddress" and some places "address". 
I do not think exact name of the field is really that important esp given 
the inconsistency in instructions. Please check field names in 
point 4 (requestObject)in "Project Walk-through" 
vs point 6 (validationRequestByWallet)

Comment from reviewer:
Response has correct format – field walletAddress should be renamed to address
Also validationWindow field should be less than maximum value (300) 
My Response:
"walletAddress" vs "address" - same comment as above.
ValidationWindow - my code is consistent with revised project instructions of 1800 sec timeout 
for valid requests and 300 sec for validation requests

3. Reviewer Comments + Specs: Star story supports ASCII text, limited to 250 words (500 bytes), and hex encoded.
My comment: How is one word always 2 bytes? Or was the spec meant to be 250 characters? 
I have modified to strip out non ASCII characters and restrict the comments to first 250 characters

4. Reviewer: "AddBlock" should not contain "storyDecoded". 
My comment. Please check point 11 in Project walk-through which shows storyDecoded to be 
part of response (though not stored in block)
